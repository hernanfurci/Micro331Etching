    "# *Theory*\n",
    "__Etching is used in microfabrication to chemically remove layers from the surface of a wafer during manufacturing.__ Part of the wafers are covered by a \"mask\" which is a layer which has different reacting proprieties to the etchant (generally it reacts a lot less), but it also needs to be easily patternable as it will  transfer its shape when the etching is done. Often this mask is a material which can be easily patternable with another process like photolithography for photoresist masks.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The __selectivity__ is the ratio of the etching rate of the layer against the one of the mask: $selectivity = \\frac{etch\\_rate_{layer}}{etch\\_rate_{mask}}$. _When it is equal to one it means both get etched at the same time, if it is equal to 10 it means the layer gets etched 10 times faster._ It is a crucial parameter as it allows to _amplify_ patterns that needs to be transfered with high resolution.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "There are two types of etching:\n",
    "#### * _Wet etching:_\n",
    "The substrat is placed in a liquid bath for removing the layer. It is based on the chemical reaction, the reaction depends on the layer that needs to be removed. Here are a  few examples: $Au$ etching with iodine chemistery ($Au + 2I^- ‚Üí AuI2^- + ùëí^-$), $SiO_2$ with $HF$ chemistery $SiO_2 + 6HF ‚Üí H_2 SiF_6 + 2H_2O$, $Cr$ etching ($KMnO_4 + Na_3PO_4$). These examples shows you already the complexity and the diversity of possible reactions. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The etching can change depending on the nature of the etchant and on the cristalline structure of the etched layer:\n",
    "* _Anisotropic etching:_ in this case the material gets etch with the same rate in every direction. It results in rounded shapes and underetching of the mask.\n",
    "\n",
    "* _Isotropic etching:_ in this case the ethching rate depends on the cristraline structure of the material as \"atoms in certain planes are more bound than in other planes and is hence a direct consequence of the single-crystallinity\". It will result in etching planes and no under etching of the mask. \n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance an acidic baths etch Si in an isotropic way while an alkaline baths result in anisotropic etching.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Wet etching is somewhat outdated in production but proves to have some solid applications for some process. Also some materials are well etched with wet etched but not with dry processes. For instance wet etching is extensively used for cleaning of a substrat with the so called pihrana process. It can also be very usefull to release structured by using the triple point of the etchant to avoid capillary forces to destroy the resulting structure.\n",
    "It can also be used for cleaning steps or to release structures \n",
    "\n",
    "#### * _Dry etching:_\n",
    "Again a mask is used to protect the layer. However dry etching happends in a plasma environement where many different reactions of different type happend at the same time. As a result the mask gets etched a lot more than in wet etching where it was simply nescessary to find a chemical spicy which doesn't react with the etchant. \n",
    "<br> In dry etching, molecules in the gas (=dry) phase, typically in the 0.1-100 mbar pressure range react with the layer to remove it. An inert gas is brought to a plasma phase where it becomes highly reactive. As for wet etching the gas will depend on the material which needs to be etched.\n",
    "<br> Fluorine chemistery, is one of the basis chemistery for dry etching as it can be an inert gas but becomes a reactive gas when in a plasma:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "$CF_4 + ùëí^- ‚Üí CF_3^+ + F + 2ùëí^- $ and $CF_4 + ùëí^- ‚Üí CF_3 + F + ùëí^- $. \n",
    "<br> For instance it can be used for the isotropic etch of the Si: $Si(s) +4F(g) ‚Üí Si_3F_4(g)$\n",
